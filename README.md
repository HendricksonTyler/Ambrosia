# Ambrosia
Ambrosia is a first-person wave survival game with an emphasis on cooperative play. Your group of 1-3 players have crash landed on a planet full of ravenous beasts. Your main objective is to survive the various waves of enemies while also defending and collecting parts for the spacecraft.

## How to Play
Your goal in Ambrosia is to survive three waves of enemies while protecting your spacecraft. You must also collect at least two ship parts per wave to repair your spacecraft. You have two methods of dealing with enemies: shooting them with your blaster or throwing bombs at them.

## Play Ambrosia
The most recent build of Ambrosia can be found on my [portfolio site](http://tylerhendrickson.me/projects/ambrosia/game.html). This is a WebGL build of the game that should work well in any recent browser. Some graphical effects may be missing however. Check back often, I'll be adding improvements and features in the future!
